====LIMA WEB UI====

Installation
-------------

Included in the git repository is an example python environment. To create the
python environment to run the web UI, you first need to install the python
virtual environment package.

1. Install the virtual environment package.
    Under debian based systems this is called: python-virtualenv
2. Go to the directory where you wish to install the python environment
3. Create the environment: virtualenv (nameOfEnv) , where nameOfEnv is the name
    of the folder you wish to use
4. Activate the new environment: source (nameOfEnv)/bin/activate

You now need to install the python packages required to run the web UI. We also need to install some packages to allow for compilation of these packages
for your system.

5. On debian based systems: sudo apt-get install python-dev libpq-dev libevent-dev redis-server

6. Run: pip install flask gevent gunicorn happybase psycopg2 redis sse thrift

7. Go to the directory where the python files are located:
    lima/python-src/lima/web/

8. Start the web UI by: gunicorn --worker-class=gevent -t 99999 web:app

The web UI will now be running on port 8000.

To end the server, gunicorn has supervisor to manage it. A supervisor can be
set up to your requirements or you can kill the gunicorn process.
